For those of you that joined us in our Call for Code Day, thank you! And those that did not, there's still time to form or join a team and get working on a submission. You're helping to show the world that developers have the power to affect real, positive change in society.

I'm proud to see you've chosen to be a part of this initiative, representing yourself and all of us here in the world's largest developer challenge. Keeping my fingers crossed that I'll be seeing one of you receiving the IBMer challenge prize. Good luck, and thank you again for your commitment to the cause.
