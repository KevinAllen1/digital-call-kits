Team,

After a successful first year of Call for Code, we're thrilled to announce the 2019 Call for Code Global Challenge. I'm also excited to bring a Call for Code Day to this lab on **[insert date]**. Call for Code, as you'll recall, is an effort to inspire developers to build solutions that address natural disaster preparedness, response and recovery. It supports the UN Human Rights office and The American Red Cross, and projects will be built on IBM Cloud. 

This year, natural disasters are expected to directly impact 80,000 people, costing the global economy more than $270 million. What if technology could help improve these figures? That's exactly what Call for Code is setting out to do. It asks developers to work out how to use AI, Blockchain, Cloud, Data, and IoT technologies most effectively to improve communities' disaster preparedness and resiliency.

This is a competitive challenge, but unlike any other hackathon, the winners will be working with The American Red Cross and IBM's Corporate Service Corps to deploy the solution through IBM's Code and Response initiative. Last year's Call for Code winner, [Project Owl](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/catching-up-with-project-owl/), has already begun this work in Puerto Rico. Like last year, there is a separate challenge for IBMers, and I would love to be able to announce that we have a team of developers among our ranks who're changing the world for the better. Last year's internal winner, [Frida](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/mitigating-earthquakes-in-schools/), sought to provide a solution to make schools more resilient in the face of major earthquakes. 

You can learn more about the specifics of the challenge at callforcode.org, and we'll be following up shortly with another email about pre-event training that you should complete to prepare for our Call for Code Day.

This is a truly worthwhile project, and I'm looking forward to seeing many you at our Call for Code Day.
