Team,

A little while ago, I reached out to you about participating in the 2019 Call for Code Global Challenge. Our Call for Code Day is just around the corner and will be held at [location and time]

This week, be sure you spend some time with the specific, free, and deep dive training to understand the use cases and reference patterns that you can deploy on IBM Cloud at developer.ibm.com/code-and-response. There, you'll find a focus on AI, cloud, IoT, and blockchain. These code patterns, articles and tutorials will help you build up your knowledge and skills to get ready for our Call for Code day.

Call for Code is a fantastic way for you to get new skills while working towards solving one of mankind's biggest problems. I'm looking forward to kicking off our lab's contributions in our upcoming event.
